# Open Bandit Pipeline Examples

This page contains a list of example codes written with the Open Bandit Pipeline.

- [`obd/`](./obd/): example implementations for evaluating standard off-policy estimators with the small sample Open Bandit Dataset.
- [`synthetic/`](./synthetic/): example implementations for evaluating several off-policy estimators with synthetic bandit datasets.
- [`multiclass/`](./multiclass/): example implementations for evaluating several off-policy estimators with multi-class classification datasets.
- [`online/`](./online/): example implementations for evaluating Replay Method with online bandit algorithms.
- [`opl/`](./opl/): example implementations for comparing the performance of several off-policy learners with synthetic bandit datasets.
- [`quickstart/`](./quickstart/): some quickstart notebooks to guide the usage of the Open Bandit Pipeline.
